- A programming language hacker at LAMP.
- Now, I am doing research around Scala's type systems with a specific emphasis on capture calculus.
- When I'm not occupied with paper writing and the intricacies of induction on derivation trees, I submit patches to Dotty, the Scala 3 compiler.
- Prior to embarking on my journey with type systems, I did research in graph machine learning and large code language models, during which I wrote a lot of Python.
