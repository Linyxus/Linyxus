- Doing my PhD at LAMP, EPFL.
- Now, I research type systems, especially around Capture Tracking and Scala.
- When I'm not occupied with paper writing and the intricacies of induction on derivation trees, I submit patches to Dotty, the Scala 3 compiler.
- Prior to embarking on my journey with type systems, I did research in graph machine learning and large code language models, during which I wrote a lot of Python.
